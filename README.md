## How It's Made:
Highlighting the natural aspects of carpentry and woodworking this website is based on symmetry and right angles with soft edges.  It's a netural colorscape with a one directional path through the website so viewers won't get turned around and potential customers won't find it too much of a leap from their current or no website.
